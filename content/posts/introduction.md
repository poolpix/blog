Welcome to Poulpix's Blog !

I am Valentin, currently working as a "DevOps". It's a very common word in the IT world now, it should represent a whole philosophy of integration between Dev teams and Ops teams, but as a job it's actually more about modern System Administration, with Cloud part, CDN part, CI/CD part, observability part.

On this blog I will  interesting news (DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering, Systems Administration), or I will share some cool tasks from my working environment (currently web), that could help mates.
