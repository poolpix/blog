&lt;p>As an SRE or DevOps engineer working in a tech environment, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely encountered
Terraform - the open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool. One critical
aspect of Terraform is its state management mechanism that enables you to track and
manage infrastructure resources effectively. This blog post delves into the concepts of
Terraform state, state locking, and backends to help you understand their significance
and usage in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Argocd</title><link>https://blog.poulpix.fr/posts/introduction-to-argocd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:50:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.poulpix.fr/posts/introduction-to-argocd/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="introduction-to-argocd-your-kubernetes-application-deployment-orchestration-solution">Introduction to ArgoCD: Your Kubernetes Application Deployment Orchestration Solution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the rapidly evolving world of cloud-native computing, managing containerized
applications in environments like Kubernetes has become increasingly complex.
Organizations need robust tools that facilitate seamless deployment, version control,
and collaboration between development teams. One such tool that has gained significant
traction is &lt;strong>ArgoCD&lt;/strong>, an open-source continuous delivery (CD) tool for Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-argocd">What is ArgoCD?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps-based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes
applications. It enables you to manage your application state by using Git repositories
as the single source of truth. This approach ensures that the desired state of your
environment is continuously reconciled with the actual state, reducing operational
overhead and increasing deployment reliability.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hosting</title><link>https://blog.poulpix.fr/posts/hosting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 09:54:22 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.poulpix.fr/posts/hosting/</guid><description>&lt;p>As it&amp;rsquo;s a tech blog, let&amp;rsquo;s first have a look at the hosting stack !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may be disappointed, no big deal here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages, the free static hosting solution from GitHub. I am using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a>, a static blog engine. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it, have a look, it&amp;rsquo;s awesome ! No need for SQL server, or backend server (php or others).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each post is deployed through GitHub Actions, if you are curious, just go to &lt;a href="https://github.com/poolpix/blog">the repository of my blog&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s open. Of course, because there is nothing to hide, it&amp;rsquo;s only blog posts that are available on the web anyway (also, GitHub pages is free only for public repos :D)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://blog.poulpix.fr/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 10:02:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.poulpix.fr/posts/introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to Poulpix&amp;rsquo;s Blog !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am Valentin, currently working as a &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a very common word in the IT world now, it should represent a whole philosophy of integration between Dev teams and Ops teams, but as a job it&amp;rsquo;s actually more about modern System Administration, with Cloud part, CDN part, CI/CD part, observability part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this blog I will share interesting news (DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering, Systems Administration), or some cool tasks from my working environment (currently web), that could help mates.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
